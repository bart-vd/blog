Today marks the start of my blogging adventure. The blog will be contain my personal writings covering anything that interests me: technology, philosophy, classical music, politics, etc. A bit of a hodge podge probably, but interesting enough, I hope.

## Static site generator

The first series of posts will more or less document my adventure of creating, building and setting up this blog. Since I decided I want to own every pixel of this blog, _and_ I want it to be fast en nimble in the browser, my choice for the main tool to build this blog is static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

Hugo is built using progamming language [Go](https://go.dev), which makes it extremey fast in generating sites, even huge ones. Additionally, it has great documentation, is structured logically (at least to my mind) and is supported by a pretty big theming community.

## Tools

Other tools for creating this blog are text editor [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (one of the best tools Microsoft has ever created), MacOS terminal app [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com), [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Github](https://github.com) for version control management, and [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) as my trusted MacOS browser.

Basic stuff, but really essential for creating the blog. Project management and blog post preparation and writing is done in the fabulous note-taking tool [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

## Deployment

For (automated) site deployment, I'm still debating whether I'm going to use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). I'll detail my final choice and how to on deployment in a later post.
