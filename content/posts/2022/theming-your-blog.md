Out of the box, Hugo does not contain any styling or themes to make your site or blog look good. This is a good thing, because it gives you the possibility to go for your own custom theme that you can build youself in [css](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), or to take the easy route and go for one of the community themes that you can find [here](https://themes.gohugo.io).

For my blog, I decided to get inspired by the [Hyde theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hyde/), using it as a starting point for my own custom theme.
