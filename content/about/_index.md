Hello. My name is Bart Van Dooren. I live in [Pulle][1], a small town in the Flemish speaking part of Belgium (that's in Europe by the way), together with my wife Jill, two kids (six and eleven) and four chickens.

As a day job, I run an [insurance agencey][2] where I am partner and CEO. In my spare time I am addicted to all things tech. Check out my ["uses"][3] page to find out about the gear I am using.

Other interests include food and wine, books and classical music. I also have a black belt in judo and am the biggest supporter of my son's soccer team.

Online, you can find me on [Twitter][4] and [Instagram][5]. If you want, you can also contact me at [bart.vandooren@me.com][mail].

And finally, for the curious, this site is built using static site generator [Hugo][6], and is hosted on [Github Pages][7].
